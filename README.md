It's a game which has game menu ( 1) play 2) level 3) stats 4) exit ).

Option 1: It's an array which size depends on the level you chose ( 1) easy(2X2) 2) medium(4X4) 3) hard (6X6)). The array contains N elements ( 1) 4 on easy mode 2) 16 on medium mode 3) 36 on hard mode ).
The elements are integers whose value is on the range (1-N/2). The array has exactly N/2 pairs of these integers. At the beggining , you cannot see any element on the table.
You can select row and column and the element , whose row and column are the row and column you selected , will be visible. You'll do it again and if the second element has the same value with the first , 
you found a pair , and from now on , the pair will be visible at the table until the end of the game. If the second element hadnt the same value with the first , the elements will not be visible . 
It goes this way for all the pairs and the game ends when you find them all. Lastly, if you press the OPTION 1 without having pressed OPTION 2 to choose level , the level will be medium (4X4).
OPTION 2: You can choose level ( 1) easy(2X2) 2) medium(4X4) 3) hard (6X6)).
OPTION 3: You can see your stats after the game. You can see how many tries you did to win and which level you chose.
